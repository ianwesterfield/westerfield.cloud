## 1. Using this guide

My goal for this project is to document by design. 

To that end, this project's documentation and structure will be intermixed. In doing so I hope to
avoid context switching as a barrier to adoption, ultimately leading to better coverage, clarity and correctness (known as the 3Cs).
