# Westerfield.cloud

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

## Business Case

I'm doing this for a few different reasons: 
- I wanted a themed, future-proof (as best as Google search can offer), full-stack application I can quickly spin up in docker to use as one-off, deep integration sandboxes. 
- I have some other projects I want to work on and I want a sense of unity between them, so I need the steps to setup an entire environment using my own best-practices.
- Kubernetes. 
- I have been wanting to pool my knowledge and preferred techniques into a single location for easy reference ;)

## Development

#### Steps to Reproduce

Refer to my [Recipe](https://github.com/ianwesterfield/westerfield.cloud/blob/develop/RECIPE.md) outlining the steps I used to create this entire application, from top to bottom and front to back!

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
