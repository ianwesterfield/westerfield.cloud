## 1. Using this guide

My goal for this project is to document by design.

To that end, this project's documentation and structure will be intermixed. In doing so I hope to
avoid context switching as a barrier to adoption, ultimately leading to better coverage, clarity and correctness (known as the 3Cs).

## 2. Symbols

| Symbol | Instruction                                                                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🤦‍♂️      | ❗**Substitute your own names for any and all obvious references (e.g. "ian", "westerfield", etc)** ❗️ |
| 🤖      | CLI action (Angular CLI, npm, node, bash, etc.                                                       |
| 🔥      | This can be difficult to debug if not accurate - please measure twice!                               |
| 🌎      | External resource (Link, download, etc.)                                                             |
| 🧪      | Run the QA Team from the workspace root `$ npm run qaTeam`                                           |
| ✅      | Merge these changes into your existing file                                                          |
